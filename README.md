opened the year at to what the closing price was; the percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed and the
total volume of the stock along with each ticker symbol. It will display postivie change in green and negative change in red. It also
reports the stock with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease and the greatest total volume. Finally, it will
perform its function on multiple sheets each time it's initiated.
